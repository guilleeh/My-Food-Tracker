This is my Capstone project for the Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree. My Food Tracker lets you log the food you eat throughout the day. You can add calories and a picture of your food to to see just exactly all you eat.

## Git Commit Syntax
According to Semantic-Release, we need to follow some commit message guidelines in order for automatic versioning to work.   
  ##### Semantic Release Commit Message Format:
  - ```<type>(<scope>): <message>```
  - <strong>Type</strong> can be one of the following:
    - feat: A new feature
    - fix: A bug fix
    - docs: Documentation only changes
    - style: Changes that don't affect meaning of code (space, format, missing semi-colons, etc)
    - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - perf: A code change that improves performance
    - test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
    - chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
  - <strong>Scope</strong> is the feature of the code (subscriptions, objects, sharing, teams, etc) being affected
  - <strong>Message</strong> is a regular commit message describing the changes
